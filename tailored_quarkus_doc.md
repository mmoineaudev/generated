In the next section, we'll walk through the process of setting up a Quarkus project, including the necessary configurations and dependencies.

**Setting Up a Quarkus Project**

To begin with, you'll need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your system. Quarkus also requires Maven 3.6.0 or higher, so ensure you have that set up as well.

**Step 1: Creating the Project**

Use Maven to create a new Quarkus project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.example \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-quarkus-project \
    -DclassName="org.example.GreetingResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello"
```

This command creates a new Maven project with the specified groupId, artifactId, and a basic REST resource.

**Step 2: Adding Dependencies**

Quarkus uses a set of extensions to add functionality. For our project, we'll need Kafka and Couchbase extensions. Add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-kafka</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
        <artifactId>quarkus-couchbase</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <!-- Add other required dependencies -->
</dependencies>
```

**Step 3: Configuring the Project**

Quarkus uses YAML files for configuration. Create or modify the `application.yml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory to include your Kafka and Couchbase configurations.

For Kafka:

```yaml
kafka:
  bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
  group-id: my-group
```

For Couchbase:

```yaml
couchbase:
  hosts: localhost:8091
  username: Administrator
  password: password
```

**Step 4: Running the Application**

With your project set up, you can run it using Maven:

```bash
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

This command compiles the project and starts the Quarkus development environment, which supports hot reloading and fast startup.

In the next section, we'll delve into integrating Kafka with Quarkus, starting with the key annotations and configurations needed.

**Integration with Kafka**

Kafka integration in Quarkus is straightforward with the built-in extension. Let's explore the essential annotations and configurations, followed by some code examples.

**Key Annotations and Configurations**

- **@KafkaListener**: This annotation is used to mark a method as a Kafka consumer. It specifies the topic to listen to and the consumer group.
- **@KafkaProducer**: This annotation is used for producing messages to Kafka topics.
- **ProducerTemplate and ConsumerTemplate**: These classes provide a way to send and receive messages without directly interacting with the Kafka client libraries.

**Configuration Example**

In your `application.yml`, configure Kafka as follows:

```yaml
kafka:
  bootstrap-servers: localhost:9092
  group-id: my-consumer-group
```

**Example Code for Producing Messages**

Create a producer class in your project:

```java
import io.quarkus.kafka.client.runtime.KafkaClient;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaProducer {

    @Inject
    KafkaClient kafkaClient;

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        kafkaClient.send("my-topic", message);
    }
}
```

**Example Code for Consuming Messages**

Create a consumer class:

```java
import io.quarkus.kafka.client.runtime.KafkaConsumer;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;

import java.util.Map;

@ApplicationScoped
public class KafkaConsumerExample {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
    public void onMessage(String message, Map<String, String> headers) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    }
}
```

**Summary of Kafka Annotations**

| Annotation            | Purpose | Usage Example                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| @KafkaListener        | Marks a method as a Kafka consumer           | @KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group") |
| @KafkaProducer       | Marks a method or class as a Kafka producer  | @KafkaProducer                            |
| @KafkaTopic          | Defines Kafka topics in a properties file    | @KafkaTopic("my-topic")                   |
| @KafkaKey            | Specifies the key for Kafka messages         | @KafkaKey("message-key")                  |

In the following section, we'll explore integrating Couchbase with Quarkus, including setting up repositories and performing CRUD operations.

**Integration with Couchbase**

Couchbase is a NoSQL database that provides fast and flexible data storage solutions. Integrating it with Quarkus allows you to leverage its features for your backend application.

**Setting Up Couchbase Repositories**

Quarkus provides a Couchbase extension that simplifies database operations. You'll need to define your entity classes and repositories.

**Defining an Entity Class**

Create a simple entity class:

```java
import io.quarkus.couchbase.panache.PanacheEntityBase;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;

public class User extends PanacheEntityBase {

    @Id
    public String id;

    public String name;
    public String email;

    // getters and setters
}
```

**Creating a Repository**

Create a repository interface extending `PanacheRepositoryBase`:

```java
import io.quarkus.couchbase.panache.PanacheRepositoryBase;

import java.util.List;

public interface UserRepository extends PanacheRepositoryBase<User, String> {
    List<User> findByEmail(String email);
}
```

**Performing CRUD Operations**

In your service class, inject the repository and perform operations:

```java
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.POST;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/users")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class UserService {

    @Inject
    UserRepository userRepository;

    @POST
    public User createUser(User user) {
        return userRepository.persist(user);
    }
}
```

**Summary of Couchbase Annotations**

| Annotation            | Purpose | Usage Example                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| @Id                  | Marks a field as the document ID             | @Id public String id;                     |
| @Indexed             | Defines indexes for faster querying        | @Indexed public String email;             |
| @Expiration          | Sets expiration for documents               | @Expiration(3600) public String content;  |
| @CouchbaseCollection | Specifies the collection name               | @CouchbaseCollection("users")             |
