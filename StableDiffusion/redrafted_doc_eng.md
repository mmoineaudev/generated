# **IA Usage Guide**

## **Prompt Format**
To interact effectively with IA (Imaginary Assistant), follow this structured prompt format for clear and accurate responses.

### **Questions**
Start by asking a list of questions to guide IA's image generation process:

1. **Image Type**
   - Do you want a photo or a painting?

2. **Subject**
   - What’s the subject of the photo? (Person, animal, landscape, etc.)

3. **Details**
   - What details do you want to add?
     - *Lighting*: Soft, ambient, ring light, neon
     - *Environment*: Indoor, outdoor, underwater, in space
     - *Color Scheme*: Vibrant, dark, pastel
     - *Point of view*: Front, overhead, side
     - *Background*: Solid color, nebula, forest

4. **Art Style**
   - In a specific art style? (3D render, Studio Ghibli, movie poster)

5. **Photo Type**
   - A specific photo type? (Macro, telephoto)

**Example:**
A painting of a cute goldendoodle wearing a suit, natural light, in the sky, with bright colors, by Studio Ghibli

### **Rules**
- The order and presentation of your desired output are crucial. List concepts explicitly and separately for better results.
- Default resolution is 512x512.
- Classifier Free Guidance (CFG) default is 7; recommended range: 4-15 proportional to prompt complexity.
  - CFG 2-6: Creative but might not follow the prompt
  - CFG 7-10: Recommended for most prompts, good balance between creativity and guidance
  - CFG 10-15: For well-detailed prompts; might affect coherence and quality above 15
- Step count default is 50. Higher values may yield better results but can be resource-intensive.
- Token efficiency: Your prompt is effectively limited to 75 tokens. Be concise without sacrificing clarity.
